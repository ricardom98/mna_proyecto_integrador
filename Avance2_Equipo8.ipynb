       " Document(page_content='1 Annual Report 2023 To everyone around \\nthe world who uses our \\nproducts, our employees, \\nand our partners:\\nIt’s a time for some gratitude, and a moment to reflect.\\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how far technology has \\ncome over the last 25 years and how people adapt to \\nit. Years ago, when I was studying in the U.S., my dad – \\nwho was back in India – got his first email address. \\nI was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) \\nway to communicate with him, so I sent a message.\\nAnd then I waited … and waited. It was two full days \\nbefore I got this reply:\\n“Dear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well.”\\nPerplexed by the delay and the formality, I called him \\nup to see what happened. He told me that someone \\nat his work had to bring up the email on their office \\ncomputer, print it out, and then deliver it to him. \\nMy dad dictated a response, which the guy wrote \\ndown and eventually typed up to send back to me.\\nFast-forward to a few months ago: I was with my \\nteenage son. He saw something interesting, took \\nsome quick pictures, and shared them with his friends. \\nThen they exchanged a few messages, and it all \\nseemed faster than the time it would take me just \\nto pull out my phone.\\nHow I communicated with my dad all those years ago \\ncompared with how my son communicates today \\nshows just how much change can happen across \\ngenerations. Technology that takes us years to \\nadapt to is second nature for our kids. Ideas my dad \\nmarveled at as science fiction – taking a call from your \\nwatch or telling your car to play your favorite song – \\nmake my children shrug.\\nThose shrugs give me great hope for the future. \\nThey set a high bar for what the next generation will \\nbuild and invent ... and I can’t wait to see what will make their children shrug, too.\\nAn essential truth of innovation is that the moment \\nyou push the boundary of a technology, it soon goes \\nfrom extraordinary to ordinary. That’s why Google has \\nnever taken our success for granted.[Letter originally published September 2023]  \\nThis month, Google will celebrate our 25th birthday. \\nIt’s a huge privilege to reach this milestone, made \\npossible by the people who use our products and \\nchallenge us to keep innovating, the hundreds of \\nthousands of Googlers past and present who have \\ngiven their talents to building those products, and our \\npartners, who believe in our mission as much as we do.\\n→\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   1AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   1 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2It all started \\nwith a search\\nLarry and Sergey first wrote down our mission \\n25 years ago: to organize the world’s information \\nand make it universally accessible and useful. \\nThey had an ambitious vision for a new kind of search \\nengine to help people make sense of the waves of \\ninformation moving online. The product they built, \\nGoogle Search, went on to help billions of people \\naround the world get answers to their questions.\\nFor a few years, I was one of those people experiencing \\nGoogle like any other user of the web. I remember \\nfeeling blown away by Google’s ability to find the best \\nanswer for the most esoteric questions, from a tiny \\ndetail buried in a store’s customer service page to an \\nobscure football rule.\\nThe questions I’ve asked Google have evolved over \\ntime: “How do you fix a dripping faucet?” “Fastest \\nroute to Stanford Hospital?” “Ways to calm a crying baby?” And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: \\n“How to ace a Google interview?” And over time, \\nGoogle got much better at answering them.\\nIt’s been inspiring to see what people have done with \\nthe answers to their questions, be it to find health care \\nor comfort in difficult times, learn new skills, pursue \\nnew career paths, or start new businesses. The idea \\nthat a student in rural Indonesia could access the \\nsame information as a professor at Stanford was \\nrevolutionary and has changed lives and our world \\nfor the better. It’s opened up access to education and \\nentrepreneurship like nothing else before it or since.\\nSearch also laid the foundations for Google to make \\nan economic impact beyond our own walls. Our advertising platforms and tools started out with a \\npremise as simple as Search itself: to help businesses reach customers who were already looking for the kinds of products and services they offer. It was \\na platform that appealed to small businesses in \\nparticular, like the mail-order business selling lobsters \\nthat was the first to sign up. And also like Search itself, the ability for any business to advertise online has had \\na truly transformational impact, helping millions of \\nbusinesses become part of the digital economy.A quarter century \\nof questions\\nSearch is still at the core of our mission, and it’s still \\nour biggest moonshot with so much more to do.\\nOf course, Google today is more than a search box. \\nWe have 15 Google products that each serve more \\nthan half a billion people and businesses, and six that \\nserve more than 2 billion users each.\\nLike most Google searches, all those products started with a question, too. With Gmail it was: Could we offer \\n1 GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail \\nlaunched, that volume of storage was over 100X what \\nmost other free webmail services were offering!\\nThen a few years later, we saw an opportunity to \\ndramatically improve web browsers – and in turn \\nthe web – for people everywhere. So with Chrome \\nwe asked: Could we build a browser that made the web better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its \\ncore? Right before launch, I had my own question: \\nWill people use this?\\nYouTube dared to ask: What if we gave everyone \\na way to share what they know with the world? \\nAnd today, it’s become a powerful platform for \\nlearning and knowledge.\\nThe questions have kept coming, and we’ve kept \\nimproving and expanding our products with new \\nanswers: What if Google Maps enabled people to \\nsee every street in the world in detail? What if we \\nbuilt a translation tool that allowed people to access \\ninformation and communicate in multiple languages? \\nWhat if you could search and find all your old photos \\nby simply describing what you wanted to see?\\nWe’ve also asked ourselves how we could best share \\nour tools, breakthroughs, and infrastructure with others. Google was built in the cloud from the start, even though we only launched our Cloud business \\nin 2008. Today, Google Cloud has become one of \\nthe top enterprise companies in the world. Partners \\nacross industries are using Google technology to \\nimprove customer support and supply chain efficiency, \\nreduce their carbon footprint, build new applications, \\nand get more done with AI. Like our advertising clients \\nbefore them, Cloud’s partners are operating better, \\ngrowing faster, and creating jobs with our help.\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   2AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   2 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3 Annual Report 2023Of course, not every question we asked ended up \\nas a success. In any 25-year journey, you take a \\nfew lumps, learn the lessons, and work to do better. \\nRemember Google Wave?\\nWe’ve also faced hard questions about our future as \\na company. In the 2000s, it was: How long can the \\nweb really last? In the 2010s, people asked if we could adapt to the era of mobile computing and whether \\nsearch was “over”? Each time, we’ve answered by \\ncoming back even stronger. We’ve done this guided by \\na singular focus on our mission, our belief in applying \\ndeep computer science to make people’s lives better, \\nand a healthy disregard for the impossible.\\nA healthy disregard \\nfor the impossible\\nThat healthy disregard is why we’ve been able to take \\non problems others couldn’t – or wouldn’t. There was, \\nfor example, this impossible idea of putting a powerful \\ncomputer in everyone’s pocket, no matter their \\nincome or internet connectivity. Today, Android runs \\non 3 billion devices all over the world, from the latest \\nfoldables to entry-level phones. It’s been at the core \\nof our efforts to make the internet more accessible for everyone and inspired other transformative products. \\nLikewise, Chromebooks made computing available \\nto schools all over the world. And Google Pixel puts the best of our latest technology – machine learning-\\npowered cameras, speech recognition, transcription \\ncapabilities, tensor chips, and more – directly into \\npeople’s hands.\\nWhich brings us to AI. Google has been investing \\nin AI since almost the beginning. We were one of \\nthe first to use machine learning in our products, \\nstarting in the early 2000s, for spelling corrections, \\nimproving the quality of ads, and showing \\nsuggestions and recommendations.\\nThen, in the early 2010s, there was real excitement \\naround deep neural networks. In 2012, a few of us \\nwent along to a demo in a meeting room near Charlie’s, \\nour main campus café. I remember watching in awe \\nas the Research team showed us the progress they’d \\nmade with image recognition, driven by breakthroughs \\nin neural networks. It was the first moment I thought \\nto myself: This is really going to change everything!I had a similar feeling when I saw the groundbreaking, \\ninterdisciplinary research happening at DeepMind, \\nfocused on understanding the nature of intelligence. \\nThis progress deeply influenced my thinking, when \\nI became CEO in 2015, that Google should pivot to \\nbe an AI-first company.\\nMore questions followed. How to power this new \\ngeneration of computing? So we invented Tensor \\nProcessing Units, or TPUs – which provided dramatic \\nperformance improvements of 30X to 80X for machine learning over other hardware at the time, \\nand powered the AlphaGo computer, which beat the \\nGo world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Around the \\nsame time, we released our landmark Transformer \\npaper in 2017, which created the neural network \\narchitecture that’s the foundation for most of the \\ngenerative AI and large language models today.\\nMany of these technology breakthroughs have led \\nto some of our most incredible product innovations. \\nSearch results for complex queries got much more \\nhelpful because of large language models like MUM \\nand BERT. We’ve created entirely new ways for people \\nto express what they’re looking for through voice, \\nimages, and even asking questions about what they \\nsee with multisearch. Now generative AI is helping us \\nreimagine our core products in exciting ways – from \\nour new Search Generative Experience (SGE) to “Help \\nMe Write” in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched Bard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate with generative AI.\\nMy favorite moments are seeing how our products \\ncan make a difference in people’s lives: Whether it’s \\na busy parent taking a photo of their craft drawer and \\nusing Bard to inspire a rainy day project for their kids; \\na traveler using Lens to translate a train schedule in \\na foreign country; or, more profoundly, a family able \\nto hear the voice of a man with ALS, thanks to our \\nresearch on speech recognition and synthesis.\\nDesigning products that help people at scale is both a privilege and a responsibility. People have their own \\nquestions: Can we trust these new technologies? \\nWe think deeply about how to build responsible \\ntechnology from the start, whether it’s making sure \\neveryone’s information is protected and secure, or keeping people safe from bad actors online. →\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   3AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   3 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4Making AI more helpful for everyone – and deploying \\nit responsibly – is the most important way we’ll deliver \\non our mission for the next 10 years and beyond.\\nAnd now AI will allow us, \\nand others, to ask questions like:\\nHow could every student have access to a \\npersonal tutor, in any language, and on any topic?\\nHow could we enable entrepreneurs \\nto develop new forms of clean energy?\\nWhat tools could we invent to help people design \\nand create new products and grow new businesses?How can fields like transportation \\nand agriculture be reimagined?\\nHow could we help communities predict \\nand prepare for natural disasters?\\nAs these new frontiers come into view, we have \\na renewed invitation to act boldly and responsibly \\nto improve as many lives as possible and to keep \\nasking those big questions.\\nOur search for answers will drive extraordinary \\ntechnology progress over the next 25 years.\\nAnd in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager \\nlooks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know \\nwe succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work.\\nThanks for an amazing 25,\\nSundar PichaiThis also includes engaging in the important debates \\nabout how those technologies will shape our society and then finding the answers together. AI is a key part \\nof this. As excited as we are about the potential of AI \\nto benefit people and society, we understand that \\nAI, like any early technology, poses complexities and \\nrisks. Our development and use of AI must address \\nthese risks, and help to develop the technology \\nresponsibly. The AI principles we launched in 2018 \\nare an important part of how we do this. These \\nprinciples prompt questions like: Will it be helpful to people and benefit society, or could it lead to harm in \\nany way? They also shape our product development and AI applications, and guide us in finding solutions \\nto emerging issues. For example, just last week we \\nintroduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images, which will help \\naddress an important issue around transparency. \\nWe’ll continue to engage with experts and the \\ncommunity to keep learning and improving.\\nLooking ahead\\nAs we look ahead, I’ve been reflecting on the \\ncommitment from our original founders’ letter in 2004: \\n“to develop services that improve the lives of as many \\npeople as possible – to do things that matter.”\\nWith AI, we have the opportunity to do things that \\nmatter on an even larger scale.\\nWe’re just beginning to see what the next wave \\nof technology is capable of and how quickly it can \\nimprove. One million people are already using \\ngenerative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where \\n460+ million people live. A million researchers have \\nused the AlphaFold database, which covers 200 \\nmillion predictions of protein structures, helping with \\nadvances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic \\nresistance, fight malaria, and more. And we’ve \\ndemonstrated how AI can help the airline industry \\nto decrease contrails from planes, an important tool \\nfor fighting climate change.\\nStill, there is so much more ahead. Over time, AI will be \\nthe biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. \\nIt’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to \\nmobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. \\nIt’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an \\nincredible accelerant of human ingenuity.\\nAnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   4AnnualReport2023_Letter_0418.indd   4 4/18/24   1:22 PM4/18/24   1:22 PM', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Part I\\nItem\\xa01.\\tBusiness\\nOverview\\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders’ letter, “Google is not a conventional company. We do not \\nintend to become one.” That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big \\nproblems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company. \\nWe continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google \\nServices and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet’s structure is about helping \\neach of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess\\tand\\t Technology for\\tEveryone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and small. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were \\nfounded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps \\npeople get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need \\nto increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense \\nof the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done \\nseamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person’s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud \\nhelps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities \\nand have invested more than $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\\nMakingAI\\tHelpful for\\tEveryone\\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world, \\nand for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and \\nmaking them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first incorporated into Google \\nSearch to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is used by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across 133 languages in Google \\nTranslate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures, such as the \\nTransformer, a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language understanding. This led to \\nthe Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped Search understand the intent of \\nuser search queries better than ever before.\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google \\nCloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-optimized \\ninfrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For example, in 2020, \\nGoogle DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, we have open-sourced to \\nthe scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating \\nnew malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-eating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information, predicting climate-related events, \\nand optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial analysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting \\nmodels that can provide early warning and real-time flooding information to communities and individuals. \\n1 Alphabet  2023 Annual Report', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we deliver on \\nour mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold and responsible \\napproach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\\nDeliver\\tthe\\tMost\\t Advanced, Safe,\\tand\\tResponsible AI\\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and rigorously tested \\nat scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we launched Gemini, our \\nmost capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and \\nseamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including text, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and \\nannounced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, \\ncustomers, and developers.\\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the \\npositive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published these in 2018, as one \\nof the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance of harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we believe it is possible — and in \\nfact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\\nEnable\\tOrganizations\\tand\\tDevelopers\\tto\\tInnovate\\ton\\t GoogleCloud\\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, \\nand the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and \\nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and \\nexpanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our own products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such \\nas Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers \\nto write, test, document, and operate software.\\nImprove\\tKnowledge,\\tLearning,\\t Creativity,\\tand\\tProductivity\\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google Translate, and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we \\ncontinue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI to \\ncontinue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace helps \\nusers write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to collaborate with \\nexperimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Dream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts by \\ntyping an idea into a prompt.\\nWe also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses — \\nand we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across all of Google’s \\nproperties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, helping them easily \\ncreate uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are experimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and conversational mode in Search Generative \\nExperience.\\nBuildtheMost\\tHelpful\\tPersonal\\t Computing\\tPlatforms\\tand\\tDevices\\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it. \\nOur latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Best Take, \\nMagic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome operating systems with \\nnew AI-forward user experiences. \\n2 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Moonshots\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism \\nleads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People \\nthought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have \\nmatured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments. We continue \\nto look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, \\nas well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As we said in the original founders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\\nPrivacy\\tand Security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly \\nupholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people \\nin control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password \\nsecurity features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle\\tServices\\nServing Our\\tUsers\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. \\nOur product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. \\nGoogle Services’ core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While Google \\nSearch started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical advancements and \\nproduct innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller screens. As new \\ntypes of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types, like news, \\nimages, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took that a step further with \\nmultisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. Large language models like BERT and \\nMultitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation \\nof digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms \\nof digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, reading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and \\nfind great digital content.\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to invest in \\nplatforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as growing \\nour family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people’s lives easier by combining \\nthe best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that \\nwe are investing in for the long-term.\\n3 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Alphabet’s investment in \\nthe portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D \\nphase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent \\nmembers and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some \\nof them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n•general purpose search engines and information services;\\n•vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may \\nnavigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n•online advertising platforms and networks;\\n•other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n•digital content and application platform providers;\\n•providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n•developers and providers of AI products and services;\\n•companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms;\\n•providers of digital video services; \\n•social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines;\\n•providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \\n•digital assistant providers.\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses.

       " Document(page_content='In 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of their \\ncarbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to contribute \\nmeaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain. \\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by 2030. \\nTo\\xa0accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute \\nemissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon \\nremoval solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target. \\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we have \\nmatched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual \\nbasis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on carbon-emitting \\nenergy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) on every grid \\nwhere we operate by 2030.\\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path to net-zero \\nemissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our \\nemissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater volume we \\nconsume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains.

These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased \\nnumbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives to phase out \\nthird-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, \\nand may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services \\nhave integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital \\nadvertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic \\nconditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWeface\\tintense\\tcompetition.\\tIf\\twe\\tdo\\tnot\\tcontinue\\tto\\tinnovate\\tand\\tprovide\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\tthat\\t\\nare\\tuseful\\tto users,customers, andotherpartners, wemaynotremaincompetitive, whichcouldharmour\\nbusiness,\\t financial\\tcondition,\\tand\\toperating\\tresults.\\t\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately \\nanticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a \\ntimely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and R&D, including through \\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range \\nfrom large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and \\nwell-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our \\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not \\nmeritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies \\nin enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and \\nprovide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do. \\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI \\ncapabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs and expectations of our \\nexisting users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our products and services and \\nfor our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party equipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or \\nmore cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary \\nrights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products and services.\\n8 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

There can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively. \\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including \\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools \\nand technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest \\nin cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly \\nevolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives. Further, our business \\nwith public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, \\nfinancial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build \\nnew products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. \\nThese investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, \\nmany of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, \\nregulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services.

In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our consolidated margins \\ndue to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins \\nfrom increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also \\nnot be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base successfully or in a timely manner.

For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect \\nour proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, \\nit is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or \\ncopyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other \\nsensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could \\nbecome so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that “Google” \\nis a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the \\nword “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, \\nprotecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our \\nintellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nOur\\tbusiness depends\\ton\\tstrong\\tbrands,\\tand\\t failing\\tto\\tmaintain\\tand\\tenhance\\tour\\tbrands\\twould\\thurt\\tour\\t\\nability\\tto\\texpand\\tour\\tbase\\tof\\tusers,\\tadvertisers,\\tcustomers,\\tcontent\\tproviders,\\tand\\tother\\tpartners.\\t\\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands \\nwithin Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and \\ninnovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and \\nother partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. \\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results.

While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, \\nmisuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches. \\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber \\nattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. \\nWe have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or other \\nparties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber \\nattacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public \\nsector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. \\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or \\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems.

There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the techniques \\nused to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change \\nfrequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect \\nattacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security \\npractices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners’ or \\nservice providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed, \\nwe could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and \\nregulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial \\ncondition, and operating results. \\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated \\nworldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, \\nmay not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident.

The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are \\nlikely to increase in the future. \\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner \\ninconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered \\nbusiness practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, substantial \\ncosts, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \\n•Competition and\\ttechnology platforms’ business\\tpractices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology \\nplatforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal settlements in the U.S., \\nSouth Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as litigation and \\nnew regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\\n•AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital products and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, while legislative text \\nhas yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU AI Act was reached \\nbetween co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other requirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based. In addition, the White \\nHouse’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence devises \\na framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate private sector use and development of certain foundation models. \\n•Dataprivacy,\\tcollection, and\\tprocessing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or \\nsharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the processing of children’s data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws). \\n•Copyright\\tand\\tother\\tintellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright in \\nthe Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, which may result in other \\nregulatory actions. \\n•Content\\tmoderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, \\nsuch as the EU’s Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain \\ntypes of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which \\nmay make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\\n•Consumer\\tprotection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\n16 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to \\nexpand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as \\nwe develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements \\n(if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or elsewhere, \\nincluding by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions.

Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and harm our \\nbusiness. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all \\ndamages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain \\npotential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims.

Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf \\nof customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and \\nmay in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial \\ncondition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation \\nand regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities \\nrequires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results \\nin the period or periods for which such determination is made. \\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may \\nbe subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, \\nvarious jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services \\ntaxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than \\n140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the \\nimplementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%.

As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock \\nownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election \\nof directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive \\nprograms, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to \\ndetermine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions\\tin\\tour\\tcharter\\tdocuments\\tand\\tunder\\tDelaware\\tlaw\\tcould\\tdiscourage\\ta\\ttakeover\\tthat\\t\\nstockholders\\tmay\\tconsider favorable.\\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of \\ncontrol or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \\n•Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors \\nor the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n•Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a \\nstockholders’ meeting.\\n•Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority \\nstockholders to elect director candidates.\\n•Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential \\nacquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting \\nto obtain control of our company. \\n•Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it \\npossible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede \\nthe success of any attempt to acquire us. \\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock \\nunless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the \\ntransaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \\nThe\\ttrading\\tprice for\\tour\\tClassA\\tstock\\tand\\tnon-voting ClassC\\tstock\\tmay\\tcontinue tobe\\tvolatile.\\t\\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, \\nthe activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world. These broad market \\nand industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \\n20 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether further \\nescalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is immediately \\nescalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. We consult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior management makes \\nthe final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our management apprises Alphabet’s \\nindependent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.\\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, \\nincluding compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and other \\nrisks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for consideration. Senior management \\nregularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should they arise, any material incidents with the Audit and Compliance Committee. Internal Audit maintains a dedicated cybersecurity auditing team that independently tests our cybersecurity controls. \\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from \\ncybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents.

We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect \\nour revenues.\\n•Users\\tcontinue\\tto\\taccess our\\tproducts\\tand\\tservices\\tusing\\tdiverse\\tdevices\\tand\\tmodalities, which\\tallows\\t for\\tnew\\t\\nadvertising\\t formats\\tthat\\tmay\\tbenefit\\tour\\trevenues\\tbut\\tadversely\\taffect\\tour\\tmargins.\\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, \\nconnected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are \\ndoing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and \\ngrow our business.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. \\nThe margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop \\nsearch. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be \\naffected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC \\nas a percentage of our advertising revenues (“TAC rate”) to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative \\nrevenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.•As\\tonline advertising\\tevolves, we\\tcontinue\\tto expand\\tour\\tproduct\\tofferings,\\twhich\\tmay\\taffect ourmonetization.\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand \\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from \\nads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When \\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\\n26 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 35}),\n",

We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and \\nadvertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging \\nmarkets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially \\nmonetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\\n•The\\trevenues\\tthat\\twe\\tderive\\tbeyond\\tadvertising\\tare\\tincreasing\\tand\\tmay\\tadversely affect\\tour\\tmargins.\\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics than our \\nadvertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products \\nand services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising \\nrevenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n•As\\twe\\tcontinue\\tto\\tserve\\tour\\tusers and\\texpand\\tour businesses,\\twe willinvestheavily\\tin\\toperating and\\tcapital\\t\\nexpenditures.\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop \\nnew, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses. \\nWe also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network \\nequipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services.

As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability \\nto pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters.

Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date \\nand involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies’ \\nfinancial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income \\napproach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and \\ncosts, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization \\nof assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from \\nthe assets. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable \\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well \\nas the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain \\ntax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.

International revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. \\nAs discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged \\nincluded the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was \\nreasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. \\nThe foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would \\nhave resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\n42 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",

When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the \\nforeign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not \\nentirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow \\nhedges for accounting purposes.

The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency \\nchange in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk \\nfrom our foreign operations.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related \\nto our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million lower \\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a \\ncorresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed \\nand asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we \\nlimit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected \\ndue to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. \\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair \\nvalue option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure securities for which we have not elected \\nthe fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our \\nmarketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates.

The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which \\ncould result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable \\ntransactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in \\nadditional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, \\nacquisitions, private sales or other market events.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period \\nended December\\xa031, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January\\xa030, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

Those standards require that we plan \\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all \\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an \\nunqualified opinion thereon. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial\\xa0statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\\xa0deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2024\\n48 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Alphabet Inc.\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In \\n2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor \\nissuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results \\ncould differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including \\nthose related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates \\non assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the \\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the \\nestimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment \\nfrom five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during \\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of \\n$3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes \\nare excluded from revenues. \\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n• Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use \\nGoogle.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like \\nGmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n• YouTube properties; and\\n•Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & \\nVideo 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\\n54 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 63}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance \\nadvertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is \\ndisplayed, or a user views the ad.\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross \\nbasis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google \\nNetwork properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts \\npaid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising \\ninventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our \\ncustomers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\\n• consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube Music and \\nPremium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•other products and services.\\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues \\nfrom Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n•Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and \\nother services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings \\nincluding our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n•Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google Workspace; and\\n•other enterprise services.\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms \\nlonger than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer \\nutilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of \\nthe cloud services.\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues \\nto each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling \\nprices based on the prices charged to customers.\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We \\nestimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that \\nthere will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nSales Commissions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an \\nasset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are \\nrecorded within sales and marketing expenses.\\n55 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Cost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n• TAC includes: \\n•amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution \\npartners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and\\n•amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n• Other cost of revenues includes:\\n•compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and customer and product support;\\n•content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \\ndistribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n•depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n•inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological \\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the \\ncriteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based \\napplications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the \\npreliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.

PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period.

       " Document(page_content='Fair Value Measurements \\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \\nan orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined \\nbased on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at \\nfair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical \\nor similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models \\nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs \\nincluding interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable \\nsecurities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at \\nfair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain \\nassets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable.\\nCredit Risks\\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely \\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange \\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk \\nexposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We \\ngenerally do not require collateral from our customers.\\nCash Equivalents\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\nMarketable Securities\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities \\nat the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as \\nour liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities \\nas available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, \\nand report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in \\n57 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 66}),\n",

We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions \\nbeyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNon-Marketable Securities\\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All \\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. \\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a \\ncomponent of OI&E.\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets \\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services \\noffered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and \\ncustomers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts \\nreceivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due \\nstatus and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of \\nfuture economic conditions.\\nOther\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing \\nthe substance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of the \\narrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies becomes \\nimpaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by \\nconsidering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current \\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is \\nmore likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized \\ncost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \\n58 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",

We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\nInventory\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary \\nbeneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly \\naffect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance \\nwith applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of \\nwhether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, \\noffices, data centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service. \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line \\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over a period of six \\nyears for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease \\nterm or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we \\nreassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or \\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include \\npayments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments \\nand account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease \\nassets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\\n59 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV\", metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

Our incremental borrowing rate is \\nestimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate \\nthe lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, \\nlease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are \\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest \\nlevel of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the \\ncarrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by \\nwhich the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable \\nor refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that \\nhave been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities \\nbased on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that \\nthey will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that \\nthey will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical \\nmerits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon \\nsettlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a \\ncomponent of the income tax provision.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for \\nrevenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the \\npurchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, \\ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity.

The primary risk managed is \\nforeign exchange risk.

We also enter into derivative \\ninstruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily \\nwithin Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination \\nof purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of \\n24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently \\nreclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in \\nrevenues.

Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness \\nare recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional \\ncurrency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily \\nrecorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, \\ncredit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.

In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys \\nGeneral and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations \\ninto Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play’s billing practices, including a \\nformal review in May 2022 of Google’s compliance with the new app store billing regulations. \\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters \\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation \\nin the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and advertising practices, \\nwhich could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others’ intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may \\nsinclude awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from \\noffering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices \\nand develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm \\nour business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to \\nlitigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an \\nadverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating \\nworkarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain \\nintellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may \\nrequire that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and \\npartners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial \\ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, \\npersonal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in \\nEpic Games v. Google  finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play’s business. The presiding \\njudge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. We also \\nperiodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in \\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse \\nconsequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have \\nbeen imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned \\nparties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\n78 Alphabet  2023 Annual ReportPart I Part II Part III Part IV', metadata={'source': 'goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

The subject \\nmatter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our \\nproducts and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income \\ntaxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n•Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, \\nSearch, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer \\nsubscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\\n•Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise \\ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received \\nfor Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a \\nconsolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments \\nas a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\\nReflecting DeepMind’s increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the \\nfirst quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, \\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current \\npresentation.\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to \\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included \\nwithin Google Services.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily \\ninclude AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such \\nas our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including \\ncertain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space during 2023 were not allocated to our segments.

    "Durante este avance, hemos desarrollado el flujo necesario para cargar y procesar texto desde archivos PDF. Este proceso implica la segmentación del texto en fragmentos más pequeños, que son posteriormente vectorizados utilizando un modelo de codificación avanzado. A partir de estos datos, hemos construido una base de conocimiento vectorizada que permite una organización y recuperación eficiente de la información.
