Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation \\nand income taxes paid.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which \\n$2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\nNote 3.    Financial Instruments\\nFair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within \\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n11\\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. \\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we \\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market \\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value \\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to \\nalign with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value \\non a recurring basis (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n2,628 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n38,106\\n \\n233 \\n \\n(679)  \\n37,660 \\n \\n1,993  \\n35,667 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n22,457\\n \\n112 \\n \\n(637)  \\n21,932 \\n \\n0  \\n21,932 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n17,243\\n \\n88 \\n \\n(634)  \\n16,697 \\n \\n0  \\n16,697 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n78,917 \\n$ \\n4,621 $ \\n74,296 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,480 \\n$ \\n6,480 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n4,282 \\n \\n0  \\n4,282 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n311 \\n \\n0  \\n311 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n1,952 \\n \\n347  \\n1,605 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n3,782 \\n \\n91  \\n3,691 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n2,683 \\n \\n0  \\n2,683 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,490 \\n$ \\n6,918 $ \\n12,572 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n12,509  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n98,407 \\n$ \\n24,048 $ \\n86,868 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income \\n(AOCI).\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n12\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n2,812 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n36,336 \\n \\n88 \\n \\n(595)  \\n35,829 \\n \\n2,724  \\n33,105 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n22,085 \\n \\n64 \\n \\n(546)  \\n21,603 \\n \\n0  \\n21,603 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n17,018 \\n \\n47 \\n \\n(642)  \\n16,423 \\n \\n0  \\n16,423 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n76,667 \\n$ \\n5,536 $ \\n71,131 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,890 \\n$ \\n6,890 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n3,998 \\n \\n0  \\n3,998 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n278\\n \\n0 \\n278\\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n1,965\\n \\n158 \\n1,807\\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n3,772\\n \\n80 \\n3,692\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n2,691\\n \\n0 \\n2,691\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,594 \\n$ \\n7,128 $ \\n12,466 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n11,829  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n96,261 \\n$ \\n24,493 $ \\n83,597 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nMarch 31, 2024 is included within other non-current assets.\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable \\nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or \\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment \\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, \\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the \\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the \\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which \\n$13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified \\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n13\\nDebt Securities\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nDue in 1 year or less\\n$ \\n8,551 \\nDue in 1 year through 5 years\\n \\n42,755 \\nDue in 5 years through 10 years\\n \\n13,972 \\nDue after 10 years\\n \\n14,043 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n79,321 \\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by \\ninvestment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in \\nmillions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ \\n1,456 $ \\n(22) $ 13,897 $ \\n(657) $ 15,353 $ \\n(679) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n827  \\n(5)  \\n15,367  \\n(592)  \\n16,194  \\n(597) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n2,945  \\n(26)  \\n7,916  \\n(608)  \\n10,861  \\n(634) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n5,228 $ \\n(53) $ 37,180 $ (1,857) $ 42,408 $ (1,910) \\n \\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ 14,539 $ \\n(116) $ \\n9,276 $ \\n(479) $ 23,815 $ \\n(595) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n2,653  \\n(8)  \\n13,022  \\n(494)  \\n15,675  \\n(502) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n4,895  \\n(79)  \\n6,851  \\n(563)  \\n11,746  \\n(642) \\nTotal\\n$ 22,087 $ \\n(203) $ 29,149 $ (1,536) $ 51,236 $ (1,739) \\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific \\nidentification method.

See Note 6 for \\nfurther details on OI&E.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n15\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These \\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $128 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the \\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize \\nchanges in the excluded \\n component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nOI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising \\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\\n16\\nThe gross notional amounts of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, \\n2023\\nAs of March 31, \\n2024\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nCash flow hedges  \\n$ \\n18,039 $ \\n17,726 \\nFair value hedges\\n$ \\n2,065 $ \\n1,847 \\nNet investment hedges\\n$ \\n9,472 $ \\n9,321 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts(1)\\n$ \\n39,722 $ \\n107,978 \\nOther contracts\\n$ \\n10,818 $ \\n10,902 \\n(1)  \\nThe gross notional amounts of these derivative instruments as of March 31, 2024 reflect a rollover in timing of settlement \\ninto our second quarter as a result of a holiday market closure. \\nThe fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n  \\nAssets(1)\\nLiabilities(2)\\nAssets(1)\\nLiabilities(2)\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$ \\n205 $ \\n242 $ \\n150 $ \\n125 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n134\\n156\\n317\\n221\\nOther contracts\\n114\\n47\\n164\\n40\\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\\n \\n248  \\n203  \\n481  \\n261 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n453 $ \\n445 $ \\n631 $ \\n386 \\n(1) \\nDerivative assets are recorded as other current and non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n(2) \\nDerivative liabilities are recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and non-current in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets.\\nThe gains (losses) on derivatives in cash flow hedging and net investment hedging relationships recognized in \\nother comprehensive income (OCI) are summarized below (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n2023\\n2024\\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationship:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n$ \\n(138) $ \\n155 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of effectiveness\\n \\n47  \\n58 \\nDerivatives in net investment hedging relationship:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n \\n(215)  \\n82 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n(306) $ \\n295 \\n17\\n The table below presents the gains (losses) of our derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income: (in \\nmillions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues\\nOther income \\n(expense), net\\nRevenues\\nOther income \\n(expense), net\\nTotal amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income\\n$ \\n69,787 $ \\n790 $ \\n80,539 $ \\n2,843 \\nEffect of cash flow hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount reclassified from AOCI to income\\n$ \\n88 $ \\n0 $ \\n74 $ \\n0 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness (amortized)\\n \\n(4)  \\n0  \\n(2)  \\n0 \\nEffect of fair value hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nHedged items\\n \\n0  \\n32  \\n0  \\n(16) \\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\\n \\n0  \\n(32)  \\n0  \\n15 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness\\n \\n0  \\n5  \\n0  \\n3 \\nEffect of net investment hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness\\n \\n0  \\n51  \\n0  \\n36 \\nEffect of non designated hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n \\n0  \\n30  \\n0  \\n21 \\nOther contracts\\n \\n0  \\n3  \\n0  \\n76 \\nTotal gains (losses)\\n$ \\n84 $ \\n89 $ \\n72 $ \\n135 \\nOffsetting of Derivatives\\nWe enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\\nConsolidated VIEs\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to \\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs \\nwere $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs \\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are \\nincluded within Other Bets.\\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable \\nnoncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are \\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any \\nperiod presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources.\\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these \\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and \\n$5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying \\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\\nNote 5.    Debt\\nShort-Term Debt\\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as \\nof December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. \\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\\n19\\nLong-Term Debt\\n Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\\nMaturity\\nCoupon Rate\\nEffective Interest \\nRate\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, \\n2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, \\n2024\\nDebt\\n2016-2020 Notes issuances\\n2025 - 2060\\n0.45% - 2.25%\\n0.57% - 2.33%\\n$ \\n13,000 $ \\n12,000 \\nFuture finance lease payments, net \\nand other (1)\\n \\n1,746  \\n1,672 \\n      Total debt\\n \\n14,746  \\n13,672 \\nUnamortized discount and debt \\nissuance costs\\n \\n(130)  \\n(127) \\nLess: Current portion of long-term \\nnotes(2)\\n \\n(1,000)  \\n0 \\nLess: Current portion of future \\nfinance lease payments, net and \\nother current debt(1)(2)\\n \\n(363)  \\n(317) \\n       Total long-term debt\\n$ \\n13,253 $ \\n13,228 \\n(1)\\nFuture finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\\n(2)\\nTotal current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. See Note 6 for \\nfurther details.\\nThe notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We \\nmay redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are \\nbased on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.0 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market \\nprices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value \\nhierarchy.\\nCredit Facility\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April \\n2024 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility \\nexpiring in April 2025. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain \\nmarket rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were \\noutstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\nNote 6.

Commitments and Contingencies\\nCommitments\\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.1 billion \\nas of March 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\\n22\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate \\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, \\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have \\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or \\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these \\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In \\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain \\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the \\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations or cash flows in a particular period. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \\npossible.\\nLegal Matters\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could \\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible \\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and \\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal \\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Matters\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\\n•\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display \\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC \\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring \\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC\\'s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in \\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we \\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\n•\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related \\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 \\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, \\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android \\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to \\n€4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a \\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n•\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for \\nSearch partners\\' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed \\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n23\\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated \\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the \\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. \\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury \\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play\\'s business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. \\nThe presiding judge will determine non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. \\nWe plan to appeal. \\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include: \\n•\\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, \\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom\\'s \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•\\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. \\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an \\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital \\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional \\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA, \\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s advertising technology business practices \\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a \\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European \\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\\n•\\nIn May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. \\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play\\'s billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of \\nGoogle\\'s compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue \\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters\\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations \\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location \\ninformation and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n24\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data \\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory \\nand government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive \\nrelief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our \\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and \\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity \\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations.\\nSee Note 12 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\\nNote 9.    Stockholders\\' Equity \\nShare Repurchases\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we repurchased $15.1 billion and $16.1 billion, \\nrespectively, of Alphabet\\'s Class A and Class C shares.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2024, $20.4 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an \\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n \\n23 $ \\n3,350 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n \\n88  \\n12,707 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n \\n111 $ \\n16,057 \\n(1) \\nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of March 31, 2024.\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\n25\\nDividends\\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on \\nJune 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C shares.\\n The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \\ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend \\nthe company’s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent \\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc.

The total amount of gross \\nunrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $10.2 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $8.1 billion, if recognized, \\nwould affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. \\nNote 13.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n•\\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, \\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and \\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•\\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. \\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are \\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate \\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and \\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space \\nreductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments. \\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\\n27\\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues:\\nGoogle Services\\n$ \\n61,961 $ \\n70,398 \\nGoogle Cloud\\n \\n7,454  \\n9,574 \\nOther Bets\\n \\n288  \\n495 \\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n84  \\n72 \\nTotal revenues\\n$ \\n69,787 $ \\n80,539 \\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nOperating income (loss):\\nGoogle Services\\n$ \\n21,737 $ \\n27,897 \\nGoogle Cloud\\n \\n191  \\n900 \\nOther Bets\\n \\n(1,225)  \\n(1,020) \\nAlphabet-level activities\\n \\n(3,288)  \\n(2,305) \\nTotal income from operations\\n$ \\n17,415 $ \\n25,472 \\nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net \\nand operating lease assets (in millions):\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, 2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nLong-lived assets:\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n110,053 $ \\n117,085 \\nInternational\\n \\n38,383  \\n39,865 \\nTotal long-lived assets\\n$ \\n148,436 $ \\n156,950 \\n28\\nITEM 2.\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS \\nOF OPERATIONS\\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together \\nwith \"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes \\nincluded under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" as updated in this Quarterly Report \\non Form 10-Q.\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further \\ndetails on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics \\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and \\ncollaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, \\napps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for \\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our \\nBusiness and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of \\nfactors, including:\\n•\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n•\\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer \\nincentives;\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and \\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \\n•\\nnew product and service launches; and\\n•\\nseasonality.\\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from \\nother sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues \\nhave been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\\nGoogle Services\\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and \\ndevices revenues.\\nGoogle Advertising\\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \\n•\\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including \\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search \\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and \\nGoogle Play;\\n•\\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\\n•\\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our \\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while \\nimpressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\\n29\\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google \\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google \\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the \\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in \\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based \\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for \\neach impression displayed to users.\\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, \\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues \\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google \\nSearch & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties \\nand the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the \\ngeneral factors described above, such as:\\n•\\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\\n•\\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\\n•\\nchanges in device mix;\\n•\\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as \\ntraditional retail seasonality; and\\n•\\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and \\nchannels.\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\\n•\\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \\nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•\\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n•\\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•\\nother products and services.\\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, \\naffected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and \\ndemand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;\\n•\\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for \\nGoogle Workspace; and \\n•\\nother enterprise services.\\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition \\nto the general factors described above, such as customer usage.\\nOther Bets\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \\nservices.\\n30\\nCosts and Expenses\\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses \\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs \\nand expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components \\nof our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. \\nAdditionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in \\nparticular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n•\\nTAC includes: \\n◦\\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and \\nservices. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment \\nmanufacturers, and software developers; and\\n◦\\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n•\\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\\n◦\\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \\ncustomer and product support;\\n◦\\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video \\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content \\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n◦\\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n◦\\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \\nGoogle Network partners.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as \\neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our \\nexisting and new products and services; \\n•\\ndepreciation; and\\n•\\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our \\nengineering and product development efforts.\\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain \\ncustomer service functions; and\\n•\\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and \\nother administrative support functions; \\n•\\nexpenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \\n•\\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \\nservices.\\n31\\nOther Income (Expense), Net \\nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains \\n(losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, \\nand income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations \\nin the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, \\nItem 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nProvision for Income Taxes \\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes \\nincurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP \\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for \\n34\\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe \\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to \\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of \\nour core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated \\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a \\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior \\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are \\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of \\nboth periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled \\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues \\n(in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\n% Change from Prior Period\\nThree Months Ended \\nMarch 31,\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nAs \\nReported\\nLess \\nHedging \\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\n2023\\n2024\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n32,864 \\n$ \\n38,737 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n38,737 \\n \\n18 %\\n \\n0 %\\n \\n18 %\\nEMEA\\n \\n21,078 \\n \\n23,788 \\n \\n204 \\n \\n23,584 \\n \\n13 %\\n \\n1 %\\n \\n12 %\\nAPAC\\n \\n11,681 \\n \\n13,289 \\n \\n(439)  \\n13,728 \\n \\n14 %\\n \\n(4) \\n%\\n \\n18 %\\nOther Americas\\n \\n4,080 \\n \\n4,653 \\n \\n(152)  \\n4,805 \\n \\n14 %\\n \\n(4) \\n%\\n \\n18 %\\nRevenues, excluding hedging \\neffect\\n \\n69,703 \\n \\n80,467 \\n \\n(387)  \\n80,854 \\n \\n15 %\\n \\n(1) \\n%\\n \\n16 %\\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n84 \\n \\n72 \\nTotal revenues(1)\\n$ \\n69,787 \\n$ \\n80,539 \\n$ \\n80,854 \\n \\n15 %\\n \\n0 %\\n \\n(1) \\n%\\n \\n16 %\\n(1)\\nTotal constant currency revenues of $80.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $11.2 billion \\ncompared to $69.7 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to \\nthe U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish \\nlira.\\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due \\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, \\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\\n35\\nCosts and Expenses\\nCost of Revenues\\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nTAC\\n$ \\n11,721 \\n$ \\n12,946 \\nOther cost of revenues\\n \\n18,891 \\n \\n20,766 \\nTotal cost of revenues\\n$ \\n30,612 \\n$ \\n33,712 \\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\\n \\n44 %\\n \\n42 %\\nCost of revenues increased $3.1 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months \\nended March 31, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion, \\nrespectively. \\nThe increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 \\nwas largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to \\nTAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google \\nSearch & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024.

In Google Services, we also generate cash \\nthrough consumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud, we \\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, \\nand other cloud services.\\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network \\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities \\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate \\nexpenditures.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to the increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase \\nin cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses. \\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable \\nand non-marketable securities.

Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of \\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to increases in net repayments related to debt, net payments related to stock-\\nbased award activities, and repurchases of stock. \\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and \\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing \\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets \\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our \\nservices and products. \\nCapital Expenditures\\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n•\\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to \\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n•\\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\\n39\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend \\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with \\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information \\ntechnology assets.\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we spent $6.3 billion and $12.0 billion on capital \\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, \\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment \\ncommences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not \\ndepreciated. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment \\nwas $2.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. \\nLeases\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.1 \\nbillion and $0.4 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under \\noperating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.2 billion. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments \\nof $3.6 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between \\n2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease \\ncosts) were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the three months \\nended March 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nFinancing\\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. \\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2024, we had no \\ncommercial paper outstanding. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and \\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in \\nApril 2025.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as \\nwell as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under \\nthe credit facilities.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion. \\nFor additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure \\nand devices we sell.

On September 14, 2022, the \\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the \\nEuropean Court of Justice.\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For \\nadditional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nTaxes\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, \\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As \\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also \\nhave long-term taxes payable of $7.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024. \\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $44.0 \\nbillion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain \\ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements \\nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those \\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities \\nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change \\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content \\nlicenses, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report \\non Form 10-Q. \\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated \\nand are not readily determinable.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023. \\n41\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. \\nAccess to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \\nour Proxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, is available on our investor relations website, free of \\ncharge, after we file or furnish them with the SEC and they are available on the SEC\\'s website at www.sec.gov.\\nWe webcast via our investor relations website our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host \\nwith members of the investment community.

In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that \\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of \\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\n42\\nPART II.  \\nOTHER INFORMATION\\nITEM 1.\\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies - \\nLegal Matters” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report \\non Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\\nITEM 1A.\\nRISK FACTORS \\n \\n \\n \\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in \\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which \\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of \\nour stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the \\ntiming), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may \\nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \\nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online \\nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously \\nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or \\ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date \\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of \\nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C \\nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole \\ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the \\nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may \\nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any \\nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, \\nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may \\nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \\ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \\n43\\neconomic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market \\nprice of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\\nITEM 2.\\nUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet\\'s repurchases of Class A and Class C stock \\nduring the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\\nPeriod\\nTotal Number of \\nClass A Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nTotal Number of \\nClass C Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per Class \\nA Share (2)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per Class \\nC Share (2)\\nTotal Number of \\nShares \\nPurchased as \\nPart of Publicly \\nAnnounced \\nPrograms\\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nApproximate \\nDollar Value of \\nShares that May \\nYet Be \\nPurchased \\nUnder the \\nProgram \\n(in millions) \\nJanuary 1 - 31\\n \\n9,717  \\n29,623 $ \\n145.11 $ \\n146.28  \\n39,340 \\n$ \\n30,648 \\nFebruary 1 - 29\\n \\n7,568  \\n28,804 $ \\n143.82 $ \\n144.75  \\n36,372 \\n$ \\n25,429 \\nMarch 1 - 31\\n \\n5,949  \\n29,230 $ \\n143.08 $ \\n143.86  \\n35,179 \\n$ \\n20,404 \\nTotal\\n \\n23,234  \\n87,657 \\n \\n110,891 \\n(1)\\nRepurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule \\n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. For additional information related to share \\nrepurchases, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly \\nReport on Form 10-Q.\\n(2)\\nAverage price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\\nITEM 5.\\nOTHER INFORMATION \\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, no Section 16 director or officer adopted, modified, or \\nterminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act).\\nThere were no “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the \\nExchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 by our directors and \\nSection 16 officers. \\nCompensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\\nOn April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of \\nDirectors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, \\nsubject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the Company (which was approved \\nand announced on April 25, 2024). This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit \\nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the \\ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding \\ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus \\nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of \\ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the \\nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\\n44\\nITEM 6.\\nEXHIBITS\\nExhibit\\nNumber\\n \\n \\nDescription\\nIncorporated by reference herein\\nForm\\nDate\\n10.01\\n* ♦Alphabet Inc.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation \\nand income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early \\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our \\nfinancial statement disclosures.\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n10\\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which \\n$2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\nNote 3.    Financial Instruments\\nFair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within \\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n11\\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. \\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we \\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market \\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value \\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to \\nalign with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value \\non a recurring basis (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n2,628 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n38,106\\n \\n233 \\n \\n(679)  \\n37,660 \\n \\n1,993  \\n35,667 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n22,457\\n \\n112 \\n \\n(637)  \\n21,932 \\n \\n0  \\n21,932 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n17,243\\n \\n88 \\n \\n(634)  \\n16,697 \\n \\n0  \\n16,697 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n78,917 \\n$ \\n4,621 $ \\n74,296 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,480 \\n$ \\n6,480 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n4,282 \\n \\n0  \\n4,282 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n311 \\n \\n0  \\n311 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n1,952 \\n \\n347  \\n1,605 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n3,782 \\n \\n91  \\n3,691 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n2,683 \\n \\n0  \\n2,683 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,490 \\n$ \\n6,918 $ \\n12,572 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n12,509  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n98,407 \\n$ \\n24,048 $ \\n86,868 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income \\n(AOCI).\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n12\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n2,812 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n36,336 \\n \\n88 \\n \\n(595)  \\n35,829 \\n \\n2,724  \\n33,105 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n22,085 \\n \\n64 \\n \\n(546)  \\n21,603 \\n \\n0  \\n21,603 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n17,018 \\n \\n47 \\n \\n(642)  \\n16,423 \\n \\n0  \\n16,423 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n76,667 \\n$ \\n5,536 $ \\n71,131 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,890 \\n$ \\n6,890 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n3,998 \\n \\n0  \\n3,998 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n278\\n \\n0 \\n278\\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n1,965\\n \\n158 \\n1,807\\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n3,772\\n \\n80 \\n3,692\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n2,691\\n \\n0 \\n2,691\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,594 \\n$ \\n7,128 $ \\n12,466 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n11,829  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n96,261 \\n$ \\n24,493 $ \\n83,597 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nMarch 31, 2024 is included within other non-current assets.\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable \\nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or \\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment \\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, \\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the \\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the \\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which \\n$13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified \\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n13\\nDebt Securities\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nDue in 1 year or less\\n$ \\n8,551 \\nDue in 1 year through 5 years\\n \\n42,755 \\nDue in 5 years through 10 years\\n \\n13,972 \\nDue after 10 years\\n \\n14,043 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n79,321 \\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by \\ninvestment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in \\nmillions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ \\n1,456 $ \\n(22) $ 13,897 $ \\n(657) $ 15,353 $ \\n(679) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n827  \\n(5)  \\n15,367  \\n(592)  \\n16,194  \\n(597) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n2,945  \\n(26)  \\n7,916  \\n(608)  \\n10,861  \\n(634) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n5,228 $ \\n(53) $ 37,180 $ (1,857) $ 42,408 $ (1,910) \\n \\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ 14,539 $ \\n(116) $ \\n9,276 $ \\n(479) $ 23,815 $ \\n(595) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n2,653  \\n(8)  \\n13,022  \\n(494)  \\n15,675  \\n(502) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n4,895  \\n(79)  \\n6,851  \\n(563)  \\n11,746  \\n(642) \\nTotal\\n$ 22,087 $ \\n(203) $ 29,149 $ (1,536) $ 51,236 $ (1,739) \\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific \\nidentification method.

See Note 6 for \\nfurther details on OI&E.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n15\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These \\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $128 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the \\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize \\nchanges in the excluded \\n component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nOI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising \\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\\n16\\nThe gross notional amounts of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, \\n2023\\nAs of March 31, \\n2024\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nCash flow hedges  \\n$ \\n18,039 $ \\n17,726 \\nFair value hedges\\n$ \\n2,065 $ \\n1,847 \\nNet investment hedges\\n$ \\n9,472 $ \\n9,321 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts(1)\\n$ \\n39,722 $ \\n107,978 \\nOther contracts\\n$ \\n10,818 $ \\n10,902 \\n(1)  \\nThe gross notional amounts of these derivative instruments as of March 31, 2024 reflect a rollover in timing of settlement \\ninto our second quarter as a result of a holiday market closure. \\nThe fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n  \\nAssets(1)\\nLiabilities(2)\\nAssets(1)\\nLiabilities(2)\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$ \\n205 $ \\n242 $ \\n150 $ \\n125 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n134\\n156\\n317\\n221\\nOther contracts\\n114\\n47\\n164\\n40\\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\\n \\n248  \\n203  \\n481  \\n261 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n453 $ \\n445 $ \\n631 $ \\n386 \\n(1) \\nDerivative assets are recorded as other current and non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n(2) \\nDerivative liabilities are recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and non-current in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets.\\nThe gains (losses) on derivatives in cash flow hedging and net investment hedging relationships recognized in \\nother comprehensive income (OCI) are summarized below (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n2023\\n2024\\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationship:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n$ \\n(138) $ \\n155 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of effectiveness\\n \\n47  \\n58 \\nDerivatives in net investment hedging relationship:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n \\n(215)  \\n82 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n(306) $ \\n295 \\n17\\n The table below presents the gains (losses) of our derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income: (in \\nmillions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues\\nOther income \\n(expense), net\\nRevenues\\nOther income \\n(expense), net\\nTotal amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income\\n$ \\n69,787 $ \\n790 $ \\n80,539 $ \\n2,843 \\nEffect of cash flow hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount reclassified from AOCI to income\\n$ \\n88 $ \\n0 $ \\n74 $ \\n0 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness (amortized)\\n \\n(4)  \\n0  \\n(2)  \\n0 \\nEffect of fair value hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nHedged items\\n \\n0  \\n32  \\n0  \\n(16) \\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\\n \\n0  \\n(32)  \\n0  \\n15 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness\\n \\n0  \\n5  \\n0  \\n3 \\nEffect of net investment hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness\\n \\n0  \\n51  \\n0  \\n36 \\nEffect of non designated hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n \\n0  \\n30  \\n0  \\n21 \\nOther contracts\\n \\n0  \\n3  \\n0  \\n76 \\nTotal gains (losses)\\n$ \\n84 $ \\n89 $ \\n72 $ \\n135 \\nOffsetting of Derivatives\\nWe enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\\nConsolidated VIEs\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to \\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs \\nwere $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs \\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are \\nincluded within Other Bets.\\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable \\nnoncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are \\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any \\nperiod presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources.\\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these \\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and \\n$5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying \\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\\nNote 5.    Debt\\nShort-Term Debt\\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as \\nof December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. \\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\\n19\\nLong-Term Debt\\n Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\\nMaturity\\nCoupon Rate\\nEffective Interest \\nRate\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, \\n2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, \\n2024\\nDebt\\n2016-2020 Notes issuances\\n2025 - 2060\\n0.45% - 2.25%\\n0.57% - 2.33%\\n$ \\n13,000 $ \\n12,000 \\nFuture finance lease payments, net \\nand other (1)\\n \\n1,746  \\n1,672 \\n      Total debt\\n \\n14,746  \\n13,672 \\nUnamortized discount and debt \\nissuance costs\\n \\n(130)  \\n(127) \\nLess: Current portion of long-term \\nnotes(2)\\n \\n(1,000)  \\n0 \\nLess: Current portion of future \\nfinance lease payments, net and \\nother current debt(1)(2)\\n \\n(363)  \\n(317) \\n       Total long-term debt\\n$ \\n13,253 $ \\n13,228 \\n(1)\\nFuture finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\\n(2)\\nTotal current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities.

We \\nmay redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are \\nbased on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.0 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market \\nprices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value \\nhierarchy.\\nCredit Facility\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April \\n2024 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility \\nexpiring in April 2025. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain \\nmarket rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were \\noutstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\nNote 6.

Commitments and Contingencies\\nCommitments\\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.1 billion \\nas of March 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\\n22\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate \\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, \\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have \\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or \\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these \\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In \\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain \\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the \\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations or cash flows in a particular period. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \\npossible.\\nLegal Matters\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could \\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible \\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and \\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal \\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Matters\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\\n•\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display \\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC \\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring \\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC\\'s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in \\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we \\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\n•\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related \\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 \\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, \\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android \\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to \\n€4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a \\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n•\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for \\nSearch partners\\' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed \\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n23\\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated \\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the \\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. \\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury \\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play\\'s business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. \\nThe presiding judge will determine non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. \\nWe plan to appeal. \\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include: \\n•\\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, \\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom\\'s \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•\\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. \\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an \\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital \\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional \\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA, \\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s advertising technology business practices \\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a \\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European \\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\\n•\\nIn May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. \\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play\\'s billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of \\nGoogle\\'s compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue \\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters\\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations \\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location \\ninformation and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n24\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data \\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory \\nand government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive \\nrelief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our \\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and \\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity \\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations.\\nSee Note 12 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\\nNote 9.    Stockholders\\' Equity \\nShare Repurchases\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we repurchased $15.1 billion and $16.1 billion, \\nrespectively, of Alphabet\\'s Class A and Class C shares.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2024, $20.4 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an \\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n \\n23 $ \\n3,350 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n \\n88  \\n12,707 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n \\n111 $ \\n16,057 \\n(1) \\nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of March 31, 2024.\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\n25\\nDividends\\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on \\nJune 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C shares.\\n The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \\ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend \\nthe company’s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent \\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc. Amended and Restated 2021 Stock \\nPlan and pursuant to each holder’s outstanding stock unit grant agreements, as amended.\\nNote 10.

Compensation Plans\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, total stock based compensation (SBC) expense was \\n$5.3 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.1 billion, for both \\nperiods.\\n26\\nStock-Based Award Activities\\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs) for the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts): \\n \\nNumber of\\nShares \\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant-Date\\nFair Value\\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023\\n \\n338 $ \\n104.93 \\nGranted\\n \\n159 $ \\n133.43 \\nVested\\n \\n(49) $ \\n107.61 \\nForfeited/canceled\\n \\n(8) $ \\n106.64 \\nUnvested as of March 31, 2024\\n \\n440 $ \\n114.91 \\nAs of March 31, 2024, there was $48.7 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. \\nThis amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. \\nNote 12.

The total amount of gross \\nunrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $10.2 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $8.1 billion, if recognized, \\nwould affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. \\nNote 13.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n•\\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, \\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and \\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•\\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. \\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level.

We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further \\ndetails on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics \\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and \\ncollaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, \\napps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for \\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our \\nBusiness and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of \\nfactors, including:\\n•\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n•\\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer \\nincentives;\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and \\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \\n•\\nnew product and service launches; and\\n•\\nseasonality.\\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from \\nother sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues \\nhave been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\\nGoogle Services\\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and \\ndevices revenues.\\nGoogle Advertising\\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \\n•\\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including \\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search \\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and \\nGoogle Play;\\n•\\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\\n•\\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our \\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while \\nimpressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\\n29\\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google \\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google \\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the \\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in \\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based \\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for \\neach impression displayed to users.\\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, \\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues \\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google \\nSearch & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties \\nand the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the \\ngeneral factors described above, such as:\\n•\\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\\n•\\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\\n•\\nchanges in device mix;\\n•\\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as \\ntraditional retail seasonality; and\\n•\\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and \\nchannels.\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\\n•\\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \\nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•\\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n•\\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•\\nother products and services.\\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, \\naffected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and \\ndemand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;\\n•\\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for \\nGoogle Workspace; and \\n•\\nother enterprise services.\\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition \\nto the general factors described above, such as customer usage.\\nOther Bets\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \\nservices.\\n30\\nCosts and Expenses\\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses \\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs \\nand expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components \\nof our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. \\nAdditionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in \\nparticular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n•\\nTAC includes: \\n◦\\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and \\nservices. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment \\nmanufacturers, and software developers; and\\n◦\\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n•\\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\\n◦\\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \\ncustomer and product support;\\n◦\\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video \\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content \\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n◦\\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n◦\\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \\nGoogle Network partners.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as \\neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our \\nexisting and new products and services; \\n•\\ndepreciation; and\\n•\\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our \\nengineering and product development efforts.\\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain \\ncustomer service functions; and\\n•\\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and \\nother administrative support functions; \\n•\\nexpenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \\n•\\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \\nservices.\\n31\\nOther Income (Expense), Net \\nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains \\n(losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, \\nand income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations \\nin the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, \\nItem 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nProvision for Income Taxes \\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes \\nincurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP \\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for \\n34\\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe \\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to \\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of \\nour core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated \\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a \\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior \\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are \\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of \\nboth periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled \\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues \\n(in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\n% Change from Prior Period\\nThree Months Ended \\nMarch 31,\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nAs \\nReported\\nLess \\nHedging \\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\n2023\\n2024\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n32,864 \\n$ \\n38,737 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n38,737 \\n \\n18 %\\n \\n0 %\\n \\n18 %\\nEMEA\\n \\n21,078 \\n \\n23,788 \\n \\n204 \\n \\n23,584 \\n \\n13 %\\n \\n1 %\\n \\n12 %\\nAPAC\\n \\n11,681 \\n \\n13,289 \\n \\n(439)  \\n13,728 \\n \\n14 %\\n \\n(4) \\n%\\n \\n18 %\\nOther Americas\\n \\n4,080 \\n \\n4,653 \\n \\n(152)  \\n4,805 \\n \\n14 %\\n \\n(4) \\n%\\n \\n18 %\\nRevenues, excluding hedging \\neffect\\n \\n69,703 \\n \\n80,467 \\n \\n(387)  \\n80,854 \\n \\n15 %\\n \\n(1) \\n%\\n \\n16 %\\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n84 \\n \\n72 \\nTotal revenues(1)\\n$ \\n69,787 \\n$ \\n80,539 \\n$ \\n80,854 \\n \\n15 %\\n \\n0 %\\n \\n(1) \\n%\\n \\n16 %\\n(1)\\nTotal constant currency revenues of $80.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $11.2 billion \\ncompared to $69.7 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to \\nthe U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish \\nlira.\\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due \\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, \\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\\n35\\nCosts and Expenses\\nCost of Revenues\\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nTAC\\n$ \\n11,721 \\n$ \\n12,946 \\nOther cost of revenues\\n \\n18,891 \\n \\n20,766 \\nTotal cost of revenues\\n$ \\n30,612 \\n$ \\n33,712 \\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\\n \\n44 %\\n \\n42 %\\nCost of revenues increased $3.1 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months \\nended March 31, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion, \\nrespectively. \\nThe increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 \\nwas largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to \\nTAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google \\nSearch & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network \\nrevenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March \\n31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.\\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months \\nended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and \\ndepreciation expense.

For additional information relating to our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nGoogle Services\\nGoogle Services operating income increased $6.2 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in \\nrevenues, partially offset by increases in TAC and content acquisition costs. Additionally, a reduction in \\ncompensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased $709 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in \\nrevenues, partially offset by increases in compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth, and usage \\ncosts for technical infrastructure assets.\\nOther Bets\\nOther Bets operating loss decreased $205 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to growth in revenues.\\n37\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nThe following table presents OI&E (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nInterest income\\n$ \\n797 \\n$ \\n1,061 \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(80) \\n \\n(94) \\nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\\n \\n(210) \\n \\n(238) \\nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\\n \\n(293) \\n \\n(462) \\nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\\n \\n377 \\n \\n2,243 \\nPerformance fees\\n \\n118 \\n \\n104 \\nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\\n \\n(51) \\n \\n(26) \\nOther\\n \\n132 \\n \\n255 \\nOther income (expense), net\\n$ \\n790 \\n$ \\n2,843 \\nOI&E increased $2.1 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, \\n2024.

Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect \\nothers to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As \\nadditional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax \\nlegislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\\nFinancial Condition\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $108.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. \\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid \\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity \\nsecurities.\\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash \\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth \\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital \\nreturn to stockholders.\\n38\\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$ \\n23,509 $ \\n28,848 \\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$ \\n(2,946) $ \\n(8,564) \\nNet cash used in financing activities\\n$ \\n(16,568) $ \\n(19,714) \\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & \\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash \\nthrough consumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud, we \\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, \\nand other cloud services.\\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network \\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities \\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate \\nexpenditures.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to the increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase \\nin cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses. \\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable \\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and \\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from \\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of \\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to increases in net repayments related to debt, net payments related to stock-\\nbased award activities, and repurchases of stock. \\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and \\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing \\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets \\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our \\nservices and products. \\nCapital Expenditures\\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n•\\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to \\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n•\\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\\n39\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend \\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with \\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information \\ntechnology assets.\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we spent $6.3 billion and $12.0 billion on capital \\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, \\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment \\ncommences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not \\ndepreciated. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment \\nwas $2.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. \\nLeases\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.1 \\nbillion and $0.4 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under \\noperating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.2 billion. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments \\nof $3.6 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between \\n2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease \\ncosts) were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the three months \\nended March 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nFinancing\\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. \\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2024, we had no \\ncommercial paper outstanding. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and \\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in \\nApril 2025.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as \\nwell as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under \\nthe credit facilities.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion. \\nFor additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure \\nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then \\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of \\nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be \\npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly \\nReport on Form 10-Q.\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 111 million shares \\nfor $16.1 billion.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2024, $20.4 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an \\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\n40\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n23\\n$ \\n3,350 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n88\\n \\n12,707 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n111\\n$ \\n16,057 \\n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of March 31, 2024.\\nFor additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of \\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nDividend Program\\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on \\nJune 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C shares.  \\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \\ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend \\nthe company’s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent \\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc. Amended and Restated 2021 Stock \\nPlan and pursuant to each holder’s outstanding stock unit grant agreements, as amended.\\nEuropean Commission Fines\\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European \\ncompetition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of \\nJune 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the \\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the \\nEuropean Court of Justice.\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For \\nadditional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nTaxes\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, \\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As \\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also \\nhave long-term taxes payable of $7.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024. \\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $44.0 \\nbillion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain \\ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements \\nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those \\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities \\nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change \\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content \\nlicenses, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report \\non Form 10-Q. \\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated \\nand are not readily determinable.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023. \\n41\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. \\nAccess to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \\nour Proxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, is available on our investor relations website, free of \\ncharge, after we file or furnish them with the SEC and they are available on the SEC\\'s website at www.sec.gov.\\nWe webcast via our investor relations website our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host \\nwith members of the investment community.

Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the \\ntiming), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may \\nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \\nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online \\nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously \\nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or \\ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date \\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of \\nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C \\nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole \\ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the \\nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may \\nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any \\nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, \\nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may \\nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \\ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \\n43\\neconomic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market \\nprice of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\\nITEM 2.\\nUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet\\'s repurchases of Class A and Class C stock \\nduring the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\\nPeriod\\nTotal Number of \\nClass A Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nTotal Number of \\nClass C Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per Class \\nA Share (2)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per Class \\nC Share (2)\\nTotal Number of \\nShares \\nPurchased as \\nPart of Publicly \\nAnnounced \\nPrograms\\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nApproximate \\nDollar Value of \\nShares that May \\nYet Be \\nPurchased \\nUnder the \\nProgram \\n(in millions) \\nJanuary 1 - 31\\n \\n9,717  \\n29,623 $ \\n145.11 $ \\n146.28  \\n39,340 \\n$ \\n30,648 \\nFebruary 1 - 29\\n \\n7,568  \\n28,804 $ \\n143.82 $ \\n144.75  \\n36,372 \\n$ \\n25,429 \\nMarch 1 - 31\\n \\n5,949  \\n29,230 $ \\n143.08 $ \\n143.86  \\n35,179 \\n$ \\n20,404 \\nTotal\\n \\n23,234  \\n87,657 \\n \\n110,891 \\n(1)\\nRepurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule \\n10b5-1 plans.

This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit \\nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the \\ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding \\ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus \\nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of \\ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the \\nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\\n44\\nITEM 6.\\nEXHIBITS\\nExhibit\\nNumber\\n \\n \\nDescription\\nIncorporated by reference herein\\nForm\\nDate\\n10.01\\n* ♦Alphabet Inc.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation \\nand income taxes paid.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which \\n$2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\nNote 3.    Financial Instruments\\nFair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within \\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n11\\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. \\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we \\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market \\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value \\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to \\nalign with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value \\non a recurring basis (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n2,628 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n38,106\\n \\n233 \\n \\n(679)  \\n37,660 \\n \\n1,993  \\n35,667 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n22,457\\n \\n112 \\n \\n(637)  \\n21,932 \\n \\n0  \\n21,932 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n17,243\\n \\n88 \\n \\n(634)  \\n16,697 \\n \\n0  \\n16,697 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n78,917 \\n$ \\n4,621 $ \\n74,296 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,480 \\n$ \\n6,480 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n4,282 \\n \\n0  \\n4,282 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n311 \\n \\n0  \\n311 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n1,952 \\n \\n347  \\n1,605 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n3,782 \\n \\n91  \\n3,691 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n2,683 \\n \\n0  \\n2,683 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,490 \\n$ \\n6,918 $ \\n12,572 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n12,509  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n98,407 \\n$ \\n24,048 $ \\n86,868 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income \\n(AOCI).\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n12\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n2,812 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n36,336 \\n \\n88 \\n \\n(595)  \\n35,829 \\n \\n2,724  \\n33,105 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n22,085 \\n \\n64 \\n \\n(546)  \\n21,603 \\n \\n0  \\n21,603 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n17,018 \\n \\n47 \\n \\n(642)  \\n16,423 \\n \\n0  \\n16,423 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n76,667 \\n$ \\n5,536 $ \\n71,131 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,890 \\n$ \\n6,890 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n3,998 \\n \\n0  \\n3,998 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n278\\n \\n0 \\n278\\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n1,965\\n \\n158 \\n1,807\\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n3,772\\n \\n80 \\n3,692\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n2,691\\n \\n0 \\n2,691\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,594 \\n$ \\n7,128 $ \\n12,466 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n11,829  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n96,261 \\n$ \\n24,493 $ \\n83,597 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nMarch 31, 2024 is included within other non-current assets.\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable \\nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or \\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment \\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, \\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the \\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the \\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which \\n$13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified \\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n13\\nDebt Securities\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nDue in 1 year or less\\n$ \\n8,551 \\nDue in 1 year through 5 years\\n \\n42,755 \\nDue in 5 years through 10 years\\n \\n13,972 \\nDue after 10 years\\n \\n14,043 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n79,321 \\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by \\ninvestment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in \\nmillions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ \\n1,456 $ \\n(22) $ 13,897 $ \\n(657) $ 15,353 $ \\n(679) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n827  \\n(5)  \\n15,367  \\n(592)  \\n16,194  \\n(597) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n2,945  \\n(26)  \\n7,916  \\n(608)  \\n10,861  \\n(634) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n5,228 $ \\n(53) $ 37,180 $ (1,857) $ 42,408 $ (1,910) \\n \\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ 14,539 $ \\n(116) $ \\n9,276 $ \\n(479) $ 23,815 $ \\n(595) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n2,653  \\n(8)  \\n13,022  \\n(494)  \\n15,675  \\n(502) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n4,895  \\n(79)  \\n6,851  \\n(563)  \\n11,746  \\n(642) \\nTotal\\n$ 22,087 $ \\n(203) $ 29,149 $ (1,536) $ 51,236 $ (1,739) \\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific \\nidentification method.

The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These \\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $128 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the \\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize \\nchanges in the excluded \\n component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nOI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising \\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E.

NCI and RNCI are \\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any \\nperiod presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources.\\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these \\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and \\n$5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying \\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\\nNote 5.    Debt\\nShort-Term Debt\\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as \\nof December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. \\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\\n19\\nLong-Term Debt\\n Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\\nMaturity\\nCoupon Rate\\nEffective Interest \\nRate\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, \\n2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, \\n2024\\nDebt\\n2016-2020 Notes issuances\\n2025 - 2060\\n0.45% - 2.25%\\n0.57% - 2.33%\\n$ \\n13,000 $ \\n12,000 \\nFuture finance lease payments, net \\nand other (1)\\n \\n1,746  \\n1,672 \\n      Total debt\\n \\n14,746  \\n13,672 \\nUnamortized discount and debt \\nissuance costs\\n \\n(130)  \\n(127) \\nLess: Current portion of long-term \\nnotes(2)\\n \\n(1,000)  \\n0 \\nLess: Current portion of future \\nfinance lease payments, net and \\nother current debt(1)(2)\\n \\n(363)  \\n(317) \\n       Total long-term debt\\n$ \\n13,253 $ \\n13,228 \\n(1)\\nFuture finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\\n(2)\\nTotal current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities.

We \\nmay redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are \\nbased on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.0 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market \\nprices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value \\nhierarchy.\\nCredit Facility\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April \\n2024 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility \\nexpiring in April 2025. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain \\nmarket rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were \\noutstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\nNote 6.

Commitments and Contingencies\\nCommitments\\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.1 billion \\nas of March 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\\n22\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate \\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, \\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have \\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or \\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these \\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In \\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain \\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the \\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations or cash flows in a particular period. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \\npossible.\\nLegal Matters\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could \\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible \\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and \\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal \\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Matters\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\\n•\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display \\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC \\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring \\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC\\'s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in \\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we \\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\n•\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related \\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 \\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, \\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android \\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to \\n€4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a \\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n•\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for \\nSearch partners\\' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed \\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n23\\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated \\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the \\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. \\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury \\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play\\'s business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. \\nThe presiding judge will determine non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. \\nWe plan to appeal. \\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include: \\n•\\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, \\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom\\'s \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•\\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. \\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an \\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital \\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional \\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA, \\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s advertising technology business practices \\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a \\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European \\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\\n•\\nIn May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. \\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play\\'s billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of \\nGoogle\\'s compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue \\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters\\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations \\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location \\ninformation and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n24\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data \\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory \\nand government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive \\nrelief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our \\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and \\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity \\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations.\\nSee Note 12 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\\nNote 9.    Stockholders\\' Equity \\nShare Repurchases\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we repurchased $15.1 billion and $16.1 billion, \\nrespectively, of Alphabet\\'s Class A and Class C shares.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2024, $20.4 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an \\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n \\n23 $ \\n3,350 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n \\n88  \\n12,707 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n \\n111 $ \\n16,057 \\n(1) \\nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of March 31, 2024.\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\n25\\nDividends\\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on \\nJune 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C shares.\\n The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \\ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend \\nthe company’s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent \\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n•\\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, \\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and \\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n•\\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. \\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are \\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate \\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and \\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space \\nreductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments. \\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\\n27\\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues:\\nGoogle Services\\n$ \\n61,961 $ \\n70,398 \\nGoogle Cloud\\n \\n7,454  \\n9,574 \\nOther Bets\\n \\n288  \\n495 \\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n84  \\n72 \\nTotal revenues\\n$ \\n69,787 $ \\n80,539 \\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nOperating income (loss):\\nGoogle Services\\n$ \\n21,737 $ \\n27,897 \\nGoogle Cloud\\n \\n191  \\n900 \\nOther Bets\\n \\n(1,225)  \\n(1,020) \\nAlphabet-level activities\\n \\n(3,288)  \\n(2,305) \\nTotal income from operations\\n$ \\n17,415 $ \\n25,472 \\nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net \\nand operating lease assets (in millions):\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, 2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nLong-lived assets:\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n110,053 $ \\n117,085 \\nInternational\\n \\n38,383  \\n39,865 \\nTotal long-lived assets\\n$ \\n148,436 $ \\n156,950 \\n28\\nITEM 2.\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS \\nOF OPERATIONS\\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together \\nwith \"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes \\nincluded under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" as updated in this Quarterly Report \\non Form 10-Q.\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further \\ndetails on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics \\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and \\ncollaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, \\napps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for \\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our \\nBusiness and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of \\nfactors, including:\\n•\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n•\\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer \\nincentives;\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and \\nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \\n•\\nnew product and service launches; and\\n•\\nseasonality.\\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from \\nother sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues \\nhave been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\\nGoogle Services\\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and \\ndevices revenues.\\nGoogle Advertising\\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \\n•\\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including \\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search \\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and \\nGoogle Play;\\n•\\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\\n•\\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our \\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while \\nimpressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\\n29\\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google \\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google \\nPlay. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the \\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in \\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based \\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for \\neach impression displayed to users.\\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, \\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues \\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google \\nSearch & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties \\nand the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the \\ngeneral factors described above, such as:\\n•\\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\\n•\\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\\n•\\nchanges in device mix;\\n•\\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as \\ntraditional retail seasonality; and\\n•\\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and \\nchannels.\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\\n•\\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \\nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•\\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n•\\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•\\nother products and services.\\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, \\naffected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and \\ndemand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;\\n•\\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for \\nGoogle Workspace; and \\n•\\nother enterprise services.\\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition \\nto the general factors described above, such as customer usage.\\nOther Bets\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \\nservices.\\n30\\nCosts and Expenses\\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses \\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs \\nand expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components \\nof our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. \\nAdditionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in \\nparticular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n•\\nTAC includes: \\n◦\\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and \\nservices. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment \\nmanufacturers, and software developers; and\\n◦\\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n•\\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\\n◦\\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \\ncustomer and product support;\\n◦\\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video \\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content \\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n◦\\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n◦\\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \\nGoogle Network partners.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as \\neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our \\nexisting and new products and services; \\n•\\ndepreciation; and\\n•\\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our \\nengineering and product development efforts.\\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain \\ncustomer service functions; and\\n•\\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and \\nother administrative support functions; \\n•\\nexpenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \\n•\\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \\nservices.\\n31\\nOther Income (Expense), Net \\nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains \\n(losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, \\nand income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations \\nin the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, \\nItem 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nProvision for Income Taxes \\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes \\nincurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP \\npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for \\n34\\nfinancial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe \\nthe presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to \\nunderstand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of \\nour core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \\nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated \\nlevel. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a \\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior \\nyear comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are \\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of \\nboth periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled \\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues \\n(in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\n% Change from Prior Period\\nThree Months Ended \\nMarch 31,\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\nAs \\nReported\\nLess \\nHedging \\nEffect\\nLess FX \\nEffect\\nConstant \\nCurrency \\nRevenues\\n2023\\n2024\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n32,864 \\n$ \\n38,737 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n38,737 \\n \\n18 %\\n \\n0 %\\n \\n18 %\\nEMEA\\n \\n21,078 \\n \\n23,788 \\n \\n204 \\n \\n23,584 \\n \\n13 %\\n \\n1 %\\n \\n12 %\\nAPAC\\n \\n11,681 \\n \\n13,289 \\n \\n(439)  \\n13,728 \\n \\n14 %\\n \\n(4) \\n%\\n \\n18 %\\nOther Americas\\n \\n4,080 \\n \\n4,653 \\n \\n(152)  \\n4,805 \\n \\n14 %\\n \\n(4) \\n%\\n \\n18 %\\nRevenues, excluding hedging \\neffect\\n \\n69,703 \\n \\n80,467 \\n \\n(387)  \\n80,854 \\n \\n15 %\\n \\n(1) \\n%\\n \\n16 %\\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n84 \\n \\n72 \\nTotal revenues(1)\\n$ \\n69,787 \\n$ \\n80,539 \\n$ \\n80,854 \\n \\n15 %\\n \\n0 %\\n \\n(1) \\n%\\n \\n16 %\\n(1)\\nTotal constant currency revenues of $80.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased $11.2 billion \\ncompared to $69.7 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to \\nthe U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish \\nlira.\\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due \\nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, \\nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\\n35\\nCosts and Expenses\\nCost of Revenues\\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nTAC\\n$ \\n11,721 \\n$ \\n12,946 \\nOther cost of revenues\\n \\n18,891 \\n \\n20,766 \\nTotal cost of revenues\\n$ \\n30,612 \\n$ \\n33,712 \\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\\n \\n44 %\\n \\n42 %\\nCost of revenues increased $3.1 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months \\nended March 31, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion, \\nrespectively. \\nThe increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024 \\nwas largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to \\nTAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.5% to 21.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google \\nSearch & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues was substantially consistent from the \\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network \\nrevenues reflected a slight increase from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months ended March \\n31, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.\\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months \\nended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, and \\ndepreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation expenses, largely the \\nresult of a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $308 million, and charges related to our office \\nspace optimization efforts of $220 million.\\nResearch and Development\\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nResearch and development expenses\\n$ \\n11,468 \\n$ \\n11,903 \\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues\\n \\n16 %\\n \\n15 %\\nR&D expenses increased $435 million from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three months \\nended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $308 million and third-party \\nservices fees of $253 million, partially offset by a decrease in charges associated with our office space optimization \\nefforts of $247 million. Additionally, a decrease in compensation expenses of $64 million was primarily the result of a \\nreduction in employee severance and related charges of $588 million.

Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect \\nothers to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As \\nadditional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax \\nlegislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.\\nFinancial Condition\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $108.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. \\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid \\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity \\nsecurities.\\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash \\nflow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth \\nof the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital \\nreturn to stockholders.\\n38\\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$ \\n23,509 $ \\n28,848 \\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$ \\n(2,946) $ \\n(8,564) \\nNet cash used in financing activities\\n$ \\n(16,568) $ \\n(19,714) \\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & \\nother properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash \\nthrough consumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud, we \\ngenerate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, \\nand other cloud services.\\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network \\npartners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities \\ninclude payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate \\nexpenditures.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to the increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase \\nin cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses. \\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable \\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and \\nnon-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from \\nthe sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of \\nstock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended March 31, 2023 to the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 due to increases in net repayments related to debt, net payments related to stock-\\nbased award activities, and repurchases of stock. \\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and \\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing \\nand financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets \\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our \\nservices and products. \\nCapital Expenditures\\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n•\\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to \\nas our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n•\\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\\n39\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend \\nfrom months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with \\nmultiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information \\ntechnology assets.\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we spent $6.3 billion and $12.0 billion on capital \\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, \\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment \\ncommences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not \\ndepreciated. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment \\nwas $2.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. \\nLeases\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.1 \\nbillion and $0.4 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under \\noperating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.2 billion. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments \\nof $3.6 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between \\n2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease \\ncosts) were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the three months \\nended March 31, 2023 and 2024.\\nFinancing\\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. \\nNet proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2024, we had no \\ncommercial paper outstanding. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and \\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in \\nApril 2025.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as \\nwell as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under \\nthe credit facilities.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion. \\nFor additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure \\nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then \\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of \\nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be \\npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly \\nReport on Form 10-Q.\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 111 million shares \\nfor $16.1 billion.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2024, $20.4 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an \\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\n40\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n23\\n$ \\n3,350 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n88\\n \\n12,707 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n111\\n$ \\n16,057 \\n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of March 31, 2024.\\nFor additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of \\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nDividend Program\\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on \\nJune 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C shares.  \\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \\ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend \\nthe company’s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent \\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc. Amended and Restated 2021 Stock \\nPlan and pursuant to each holder’s outstanding stock unit grant agreements, as amended.\\nEuropean Commission Fines\\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European \\ncompetition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of \\nJune 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the \\nGeneral Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the \\nEuropean Court of Justice.\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For \\nadditional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this \\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nTaxes\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, \\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As \\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also \\nhave long-term taxes payable of $7.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2024. \\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $44.0 \\nbillion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain \\ntechnical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements \\nrelated to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those \\nagreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities \\nand/or pricing as of March 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change \\nbased on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content \\nlicenses, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report \\non Form 10-Q. \\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated \\nand are not readily determinable.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nSee Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023. \\n41\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. \\nAccess to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \\nour Proxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, is available on our investor relations website, free of \\ncharge, after we file or furnish them with the SEC and they are available on the SEC\\'s website at www.sec.gov.\\nWe webcast via our investor relations website our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host \\nwith members of the investment community.

Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives to phase out third-party cookies (which remain subject to review, affecting the \\ntiming), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may \\nin the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \\nmake customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online \\nservices have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-\\nparty digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously \\nactive or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or \\ndividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date \\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of \\nshares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of a cash dividend to our Class A, Class B and Class C \\nstockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors at their sole \\ndiscretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the \\nDelaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may \\nnot declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend in any \\nspecific dollar amount per share. Further, our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, \\nincrease their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may \\nresult in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \\ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \\n43\\neconomic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market \\nprice of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\\nITEM 2.\\nUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet\\'s repurchases of Class A and Class C stock \\nduring the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\\nPeriod\\nTotal Number of \\nClass A Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nTotal Number of \\nClass C Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per Class \\nA Share (2)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per Class \\nC Share (2)\\nTotal Number of \\nShares \\nPurchased as \\nPart of Publicly \\nAnnounced \\nPrograms\\n(in thousands) \\n(1)\\nApproximate \\nDollar Value of \\nShares that May \\nYet Be \\nPurchased \\nUnder the \\nProgram \\n(in millions) \\nJanuary 1 - 31\\n \\n9,717  \\n29,623 $ \\n145.11 $ \\n146.28  \\n39,340 \\n$ \\n30,648 \\nFebruary 1 - 29\\n \\n7,568  \\n28,804 $ \\n143.82 $ \\n144.75  \\n36,372 \\n$ \\n25,429 \\nMarch 1 - 31\\n \\n5,949  \\n29,230 $ \\n143.08 $ \\n143.86  \\n35,179 \\n$ \\n20,404 \\nTotal\\n \\n23,234  \\n87,657 \\n \\n110,891 \\n(1)\\nRepurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \\ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule \\n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. For additional information related to share \\nrepurchases, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly \\nReport on Form 10-Q.\\n(2)\\nAverage price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\\nITEM 5.\\nOTHER INFORMATION \\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, no Section 16 director or officer adopted, modified, or \\nterminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act).\\nThere were no “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the \\nExchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 by our directors and \\nSection 16 officers. \\nCompensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\\nOn April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of \\nDirectors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, \\nsubject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the Company (which was approved \\nand announced on April 25, 2024). This approval covers both performance stock unit awards and Google stock unit \\nawards, and applies both to currently outstanding and future equity awards. For the avoidance of doubt, the \\ncorresponding amendments to the respective stock unit grant agreements will apply both to currently outstanding \\ngrant agreements and all future grant agreements. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus \\nwould not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of \\ndividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the \\nstock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.\\n44\\nITEM 6.\\nEXHIBITS\\nExhibit\\nNumber\\n \\n \\nDescription\\nIncorporated by reference herein\\nForm\\nDate\\n10.01\\n* ♦Alphabet Inc.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in \\nAugust 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. \\n(\\\"Alphabet\\\") became the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that \\nprovide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal \\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of \\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual \\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in \\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form \\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \\\"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \\\"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \\nDisclosures\\\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation \\nand income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early \\nadoption permitted.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \\nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for \\nthese commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when \\nour customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over \\nthe next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred \\nrevenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with \\nan original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, \\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google \\nsubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which \\n$2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\nNote 3.    Financial Instruments\\nFair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within \\nLevel 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n11\\nor inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. \\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we \\nuse quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market \\nobservable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value \\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to \\nalign with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value \\non a recurring basis (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,628 \\n$ \\n2,628 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n38,106\\n \\n233 \\n \\n(679)  \\n37,660 \\n \\n1,993  \\n35,667 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n22,457\\n \\n112 \\n \\n(637)  \\n21,932 \\n \\n0  \\n21,932 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n17,243\\n \\n88 \\n \\n(634)  \\n16,697 \\n \\n0  \\n16,697 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n78,917 \\n$ \\n4,621 $ \\n74,296 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,480 \\n$ \\n6,480 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n4,282 \\n \\n0  \\n4,282 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n311 \\n \\n0  \\n311 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n1,952 \\n \\n347  \\n1,605 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n3,782 \\n \\n91  \\n3,691 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n2,683 \\n \\n0  \\n2,683 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,490 \\n$ \\n6,918 $ \\n12,572 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n12,509  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n80,434 \\n$ \\n433 \\n$ \\n(1,950) $ \\n98,407 \\n$ \\n24,048 $ \\n86,868 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income \\n(AOCI).\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n12\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\nFair Value \\nHierarchy\\nAdjusted \\nCost\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nGains\\nGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses\\nFair Value\\nCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalents\\nMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive \\nincome\\nTime deposits\\nLevel 2\\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n0 \\n$ \\n2,812 \\n$ \\n2,812 $ \\n0 \\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n \\n36,336 \\n \\n88 \\n \\n(595)  \\n35,829 \\n \\n2,724  \\n33,105 \\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n22,085 \\n \\n64 \\n \\n(546)  \\n21,603 \\n \\n0  \\n21,603 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n \\n17,018 \\n \\n47 \\n \\n(642)  \\n16,423 \\n \\n0  \\n16,423 \\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange reflected in \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincome(1)\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n76,667 \\n$ \\n5,536 $ \\n71,131 \\nFair value \\nadjustments \\nrecorded in net \\nincome\\nMoney market funds\\nLevel 1\\n$ \\n6,890 \\n$ \\n6,890 $ \\n0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(2)\\nLevel 1\\n \\n3,998 \\n \\n0  \\n3,998 \\nMutual funds\\nLevel 2\\n278\\n \\n0 \\n278\\nGovernment bonds\\nLevel 2\\n1,965\\n \\n158 \\n1,807\\nCorporate debt \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n3,772\\n \\n80 \\n3,692\\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed \\nsecurities\\nLevel 2\\n2,691\\n \\n0 \\n2,691\\nTotal investments \\nwith fair value \\nchange recorded in \\nnet income\\n$ \\n19,594 \\n$ \\n7,128 $ \\n12,466 \\nCash\\n \\n0 \\n \\n11,829  \\n0 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n78,251 \\n$ \\n199 \\n$ \\n(1,783) $ \\n96,261 \\n$ \\n24,493 $ \\n83,597 \\n(1)\\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(2)\\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \\nMarch 31, 2024 is included within other non-current assets.\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable \\nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or \\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment \\nare classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, \\nand common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the \\ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the \\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.4 billion, of which \\n$13.6 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and primarily classified \\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n13\\nDebt Securities\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nDue in 1 year or less\\n$ \\n8,551 \\nDue in 1 year through 5 years\\n \\n42,755 \\nDue in 5 years through 10 years\\n \\n13,972 \\nDue after 10 years\\n \\n14,043 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n79,321 \\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by \\ninvestment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in \\nmillions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ \\n1,456 $ \\n(22) $ 13,897 $ \\n(657) $ 15,353 $ \\n(679) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n827  \\n(5)  \\n15,367  \\n(592)  \\n16,194  \\n(597) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n2,945  \\n(26)  \\n7,916  \\n(608)  \\n10,861  \\n(634) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n5,228 $ \\n(53) $ 37,180 $ (1,857) $ 42,408 $ (1,910) \\n \\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ 14,539 $ \\n(116) $ \\n9,276 $ \\n(479) $ 23,815 $ \\n(595) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n2,653  \\n(8)  \\n13,022  \\n(494)  \\n15,675  \\n(502) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n4,895  \\n(79)  \\n6,851  \\n(563)  \\n11,746  \\n(642) \\nTotal\\n$ 22,087 $ \\n(203) $ 29,149 $ (1,536) $ 51,236 $ (1,739) \\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific \\nidentification method.

Our share of gains and losses, including \\nimpairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for \\nfurther details on OI&E.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n15\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, \\nearnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance \\ninvestment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \\nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy \\ncomprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at \\ngross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These \\ncontracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points \\nand time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life \\nof the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and \\nthe amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $128 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in \\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the \\nrelated hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize \\nchanges in the excluded \\n component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude \\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in \\nOI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising \\nfrom other derivatives are primarily reflected within the \\u201cother\\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.\\n16\\nThe gross notional amounts of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, \\n2023\\nAs of March 31, \\n2024\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nCash flow hedges  \\n$ \\n18,039 $ \\n17,726 \\nFair value hedges\\n$ \\n2,065 $ \\n1,847 \\nNet investment hedges\\n$ \\n9,472 $ \\n9,321 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts(1)\\n$ \\n39,722 $ \\n107,978 \\nOther contracts\\n$ \\n10,818 $ \\n10,902 \\n(1)  \\nThe gross notional amounts of these derivative instruments as of March 31, 2024 reflect a rollover in timing of settlement \\ninto our second quarter as a result of a holiday market closure. \\nThe fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\nAs of March 31, 2024\\n  \\nAssets(1)\\nLiabilities(2)\\nAssets(1)\\nLiabilities(2)\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$ \\n205 $ \\n242 $ \\n150 $ \\n125 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n134\\n156\\n317\\n221\\nOther contracts\\n114\\n47\\n164\\n40\\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\\n \\n248  \\n203  \\n481  \\n261 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n453 $ \\n445 $ \\n631 $ \\n386 \\n(1) \\nDerivative assets are recorded as other current and non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n(2) \\nDerivative liabilities are recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and non-current in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets.\\nThe gains (losses) on derivatives in cash flow hedging and net investment hedging relationships recognized in \\nother comprehensive income (OCI) are summarized below (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nMarch 31,\\n2023\\n2024\\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationship:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n$ \\n(138) $ \\n155 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of effectiveness\\n \\n47  \\n58 \\nDerivatives in net investment hedging relationship:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount included in the assessment of effectiveness\\n \\n(215)  \\n82 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n(306) $ \\n295 \\n17\\n The table below presents the gains (losses) of our derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income: (in \\nmillions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues\\nOther income \\n(expense), net\\nRevenues\\nOther income \\n(expense), net\\nTotal amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income\\n$ \\n69,787 $ \\n790 $ \\n80,539 $ \\n2,843 \\nEffect of cash flow hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount reclassified from AOCI to income\\n$ \\n88 $ \\n0 $ \\n74 $ \\n0 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness (amortized)\\n \\n(4)  \\n0  \\n(2)  \\n0 \\nEffect of fair value hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nHedged items\\n \\n0  \\n32  \\n0  \\n(16) \\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\\n \\n0  \\n(32)  \\n0  \\n15 \\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness\\n \\n0  \\n5  \\n0  \\n3 \\nEffect of net investment hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nAmount excluded from the assessment of \\neffectiveness\\n \\n0  \\n51  \\n0  \\n36 \\nEffect of non designated hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n \\n0  \\n30  \\n0  \\n21 \\nOther contracts\\n \\n0  \\n3  \\n0  \\n76 \\nTotal gains (losses)\\n$ \\n84 $ \\n89 $ \\n72 $ \\n135 \\nOffsetting of Derivatives\\nWe enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk.

Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\\nConsolidated VIEs\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to \\nus. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs \\nwere $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs \\nwere $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are \\nincluded within Other Bets.\\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion is redeemable \\nnoncontrolling interest (RNCI) as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. NCI and RNCI are \\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any \\nperiod presented and is included within the \\\"other\\\" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private \\ncompanies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve \\npower generation using renewable sources.\\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results \\nof operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We \\naccount for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these \\nunconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and \\n$5.3 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying \\nvalue relates primarily to future funding commitments.\\nNote 5.    Debt\\nShort-Term Debt\\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as \\nof December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. \\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\\n19\\nLong-Term Debt\\n Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\\nMaturity\\nCoupon Rate\\nEffective Interest \\nRate\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, \\n2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, \\n2024\\nDebt\\n2016-2020 Notes issuances\\n2025 - 2060\\n0.45% - 2.25%\\n0.57% - 2.33%\\n$ \\n13,000 $ \\n12,000 \\nFuture finance lease payments, net \\nand other (1)\\n \\n1,746  \\n1,672 \\n      Total debt\\n \\n14,746  \\n13,672 \\nUnamortized discount and debt \\nissuance costs\\n \\n(130)  \\n(127) \\nLess: Current portion of long-term \\nnotes(2)\\n \\n(1,000)  \\n0 \\nLess: Current portion of future \\nfinance lease payments, net and \\nother current debt(1)(2)\\n \\n(363)  \\n(317) \\n       Total long-term debt\\n$ \\n13,253 $ \\n13,228 \\n(1)\\nFuture finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.\\n(2)\\nTotal current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. See Note 6 for \\nfurther details.\\nThe notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We \\nmay redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are \\nbased on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.0 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market \\nprices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value \\nhierarchy.\\nCredit Facility\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April \\n2024 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. In April 2024, we entered into a new $4.0 billion revolving credit facility \\nexpiring in April 2025. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain \\nmarket rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were \\noutstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\nNote 6.

Commitments and Contingencies\\nCommitments\\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.1 billion \\nas of March 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\\n22\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate \\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, \\ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have \\nagreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or \\ncovenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these \\nagreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In \\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain \\nsimilar indemnification obligations to our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the \\nfuture, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of \\noperations or cash flows in a particular period. \\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \\npossible.\\nLegal Matters\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could \\naffect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible \\nlosses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and \\nwe may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal \\nmatters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Matters\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\\n\\u2022\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display \\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a \\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC \\ndecision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring \\nshopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in \\nthe second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we \\nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\n\\u2022\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\\u2019s Android-related \\ndistribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \\u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 \\nbillion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, \\nwe appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android \\ndistribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \\u20ac4.3 billion to \\n\\u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a \\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n\\u2022\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that \\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision \\nimposed a fine of \\u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for \\nSearch partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed \\nthe EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n23\\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated \\nU.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the \\ntrial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. \\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury \\nfound that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. \\nThe presiding judge will determine non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. \\nWe plan to appeal. \\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss include: \\n\\u2022\\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, \\nin June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n\\u2022\\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. \\nAdditionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an \\nantitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\\u2019s digital \\nadvertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional \\nstate Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled for September 2024. The EC, the CMA, \\nand the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices \\non June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a \\nStatement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European \\nantitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.\\n\\u2022\\nIn May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\\u2019s business practices. \\nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of \\nGoogle's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue \\nto cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nPrivacy Matters\\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations \\nand litigation in the U.S. and the European Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location \\ninformation and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in \\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or \\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have \\nto change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss \\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has \\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC \\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important \\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing \\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n24\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such \\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In \\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a \\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data \\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory \\nand government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive \\nrelief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our \\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which \\ncould harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. \\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied \\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We \\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax \\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and \\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity \\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially \\ndifferent from our expectations.\\nSee Note 12 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\\nNote 9.    Stockholders' Equity \\nShare Repurchases\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we repurchased $15.1 billion and $16.1 billion, \\nrespectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2024, $20.4 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an \\nadditional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n \\n23 $ \\n3,350 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n \\n88  \\n12,707 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n \\n111 $ \\n16,057 \\n(1) \\nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of March 31, 2024.\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\n25\\nDividends\\nOn April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on \\nJune 17, 2024, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company\\u2019s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C shares.\\n The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \\ncompany\\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. In connection with the cash dividend (and any future dividend \\nthe company\\u2019s Board of Directors may declare from time to time), the company will also award dividend equivalent \\nunits to holders of all unvested stock units in accordance with the Alphabet Inc. Amended and Restated 2021 Stock \\nPlan and pursuant to each holder\\u2019s outstanding stock unit grant agreements, as amended.\\nNote 10.

Compensation Plans\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, total stock based compensation (SBC) expense was \\n$5.3 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.1 billion, for both \\nperiods.\\n26\\nStock-Based Award Activities\\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs) for the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts): \\n \\nNumber of\\nShares \\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant-Date\\nFair Value\\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023\\n \\n338 $ \\n104.93 \\nGranted\\n \\n159 $ \\n133.43 \\nVested\\n \\n(49) $ \\n107.61 \\nForfeited/canceled\\n \\n(8) $ \\n106.64 \\nUnvested as of March 31, 2024\\n \\n440 $ \\n114.91 \\nAs of March 31, 2024, there was $48.7 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. \\nThis amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. \\nNote 12.    Income Taxes \\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):\\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n2023\\n2024\\nIncome before provision for income taxes\\n$ \\n18,205 \\n$ \\n28,315 \\nProvision for income taxes\\n$ \\n3,154 \\n$ \\n4,653 \\nEffective tax rate\\n \\n17.3 %\\n \\n16.4 %\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in \\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross \\nunrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $10.2 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $8.1 billion, if recognized, \\nwould affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. \\nNote 13.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n\\u2022\\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, \\nand NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\\n\\u2022\\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and \\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n\\u2022\\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues \\nfrom Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. \\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are \\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \\nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate \\ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and \\nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space \\nreductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments. \\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\\n27\\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nRevenues:\\nGoogle Services\\n$ \\n61,961 $ \\n70,398 \\nGoogle Cloud\\n \\n7,454  \\n9,574 \\nOther Bets\\n \\n288  \\n495 \\nHedging gains (losses)\\n \\n84  \\n72 \\nTotal revenues\\n$ \\n69,787 $ \\n80,539 \\n \\nThree Months Ended\\nMarch 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2024\\nOperating income (loss):\\nGoogle Services\\n$ \\n21,737 $ \\n27,897 \\nGoogle Cloud\\n \\n191  \\n900 \\nOther Bets\\n \\n(1,225)  \\n(1,020) \\nAlphabet-level activities\\n \\n(3,288)  \\n(2,305) \\nTotal income from operations\\n$ \\n17,415 $ \\n25,472 \\nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net \\nand operating lease assets (in millions):\\nAs of \\nDecember 31, 2023\\nAs of\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nLong-lived assets:\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n110,053 $ \\n117,085 \\nInternational\\n \\n38,383  \\n39,865 \\nTotal long-lived assets\\n$ \\n148,436 $ \\n156,950 \\n28\\nITEM 2.\\nMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS \\nOF OPERATIONS\\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together \\nwith \\\"Note About Forward-Looking Statements\\\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes \\nincluded under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Longitud\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17044,\n        \"min\": 142,\n        \"max\": 66466,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4561,\n          142,\n          66466\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
